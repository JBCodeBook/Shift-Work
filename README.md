## Introduction
Shift work is a game about office work. This project started out as an assignment for a game design class but has grown since then to be a personal sandbox to learn some C# and game design. The goal of the game is to get through your first day at a new job before the time runs out. Each floor of the office is a new level with a new challenge to beat.
